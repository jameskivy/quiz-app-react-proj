# Overview:

I have created a Trivia Quiz Application that allows users to test their knowledge across several different categories. The user has an experience of selecting a category, a difficulty between easy, medium, or hard, the amount of questions, and a option between T/F or Multiple choice.

<br>

# The Team:

This was an individual project created by James Ivy.

<br>

# Tools used in the project:

- React
- Redux
- Material-UI (MUI)

<br>

# APIs:

- Open Trivia Database: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

<br>

# Basic Objectives:
<br>
<!-- Allow user to search for video game content that will return a information about the game. -->

# Flex Goals Completed:
<br>
<!-- - Allow users to search any video game of their choice and be able to provide a description for them. 
- Implement nice CSS animations and/or hover effects. -->


# Stretch Goals Future:
<br>
<!-- - Allow users to browse through a top sellers and new releases tab on our website. 
- Find a second API call to implement. -->


# Challenges & Solutions:
<br>
<!-- - Challenge: The user would have to search the name of the game with the exact match, for example, if a colon was used then a colon would have to be typed  for the results to return. 
- Solution: Pull data and save information to the local storage. -->
